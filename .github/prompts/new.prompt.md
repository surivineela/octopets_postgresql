description: 'Create a proposal'

I want to build an app. My idea was attached in the prompt I sent you.

Let's join forces to make this idea into a simple, yet impactful proposal.

FIRST:
- Clarify any areas of my proposal that may need more details
- Suggest new requirements based on the functionality provided
- Consider edge cases that may not be included in my original proposal.
- Organize requirements logically, and break them down into units that would make sense as user stories.
- Raise any important high-level technical considerations, like platforms, languages, frameworks, and overall architecture details

NEXT:
- Iterate with me until I tell you I am satisfied.

FINALLY:
- Once I tell you I am ready, create a plan (or update an existing plan) in #file:../../docs/plans/idea.md with the following structure as a Markdown file:

```
